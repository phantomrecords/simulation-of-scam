# Simulation of Scam

This repository simulates the interface and user experience used in a real-world cyber fraud scheme.
The scam involved impersonation of job recruiters and training mentors, leading victims to invest in
fake "employment programs" under pressure and manipulation.

This reconstruction is based on actual experiences and is intended for:

- Documentation and preservation of scam patterns
- Education of the public and tech community
- Reference for law enforcement and cybersecurity analysts

⚠️ This is a simulation. No live scam infrastructure or harmful content is hosted here.
